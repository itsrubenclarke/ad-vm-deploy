<h1>Active Directory: Virtual Machine Deployment</h1>

<p>
This project is the first among a collection focused on implementing Azure and Active Directory. 
The goal is to create a basic lab that mirrors a real working network environment, providing me with hands-on learning and practical experience with Microsoft Azure and Active Directory.
In this project, I will set up and establish a connection between two virtual machines using Windows Server 2022 and Windows Pro 10 in Microsoft Azure's Cloud environment. 
Assign a static private IP, disable Windows Defender firewalls, and ensuring network connectivity through DNS configuration and PowerShell verification
This will allow me to establish a Domain Controller and a Client.
</p>

- Launch your Remote Desktop Connection Application
    - Mac Users download <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/windows-app/id1295203466?mt=12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows App</a> Formerly known as "Microsoft Remote Desktop"
    - Windows Users open and use Remote Desktop
- Select "Add PC"
- Enter the Public IP Address from your Domain Controller "172.187.161.247"
- Add a friendly name "dc-1"
- Choose "Add Credentials" from the drop down and enter the credentials you created earlier, noting to accept the security prompt and proceed
- You can now establish a remote connection to your virtual machine, by right-clicking the newly added device
- Accept the Certificate when prompted to do so

- This will open up "Windows Defender" from here you need to disable the following fireawall states:
    - Domain Profile
    - Private Profile
    - Public Profile

<h1>Project Summary</h1></p>

🎉Congratulations! You have succesfully deployed a Virtual Network in Azure!🎉

In this project, we configured and deployed a Windows Server 2022 Virtual Machine as a Domain Controller and a Windows 10 Pro Virtual Machine as a Client within a Microsoft Azure environment.
We established remote desktop connections (RDP) to both VMs and configured DNS settings on the client to connect it to the domain controller.
Additionally, we assigned a static private IP address to the domain controller, disabled Windows Defender firewall profiles, and verified network connectivity using PowerShell by successfully pinging the domain controller from the client.
